### 1. Restore Variables

- From VS Code Terminal tab, open developer command prompt or PowerShell terminal in the project folder `TasksTracker.ContainerApps`

    ```shell
    cd ~\TasksTracker.ContainerApps
    ```

- Restore the previously-stored variables by executing the local script. The output informs you how many variables have been set.

    ```shell
    .\Variables.ps1
    ```
