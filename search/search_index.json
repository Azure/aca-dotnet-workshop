Microsoft announced the public preview of Azure Container Apps in November 2021, and in May 2022 it announced the General Availability of Azure Container Apps. In brief, Azure Container Apps is a fully managed, serverless, Kubernetes-based container runtime for building and running cloud-native applications which focuses on the business logic of the apps rather than on cloud infrastructure management.</p>"},{"location":"#contributions","title":"Contributions","text":"<p>We are most grateful for community involvement.

It contains one or more container apps. All container apps within an environment are deployed into a dedicated Azure Virtual Network, which makes it possible for these different container apps to communicate securely. In addition, all the logs produced from all container apps in the environment are sent to a dedicated Log Analytics workspace.</p> </li> <li> <p>Log Analytics workspace Used to provide monitoring and observability functionality. Each environment will have its own Log Analytics workspace and will be shared among all container apps within the environment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Container Apps Each container App represents a single deployable unit that can contain one or more related containers. Using more than one container in a container app is an advanced use case. For this workshop we will deploy a single container in each container app. More about multiple containers in the same single Azure Container App can be found here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Revisions For each container app, you can create up to 100 revisions. Revisions are a way to deploy multiple versions of an app where you have the option to send the traffic to a certain revision. You can select if revision mode will support one or multiple active revisions at the same time to support A/B testing scenarios or canary deployments. A container app running in single revision mode will have a single revision that is backed by zero-many Pods/replicas.</p> </li> <li> <p>Containers Containers in the Azure Container Apps are grouped together in pods/replicas inside revision snapshots. A pod/replica is composed of the application container and any required sidecar containers. Containers can be deployed from any public or private container registry, and they support any Linux-based x86-64 (linux/amd64) images. At the time of creating this workshop Windows based images are not supported.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"aca/00-workshop-intro/2-scenario-architecture/","title":"Scenario and Solution Architecture","text":""},{"location":"aca/00-workshop-intro/2-scenario-architecture/#workshop-scenario","title":"Workshop Scenario","text":"<p>In this workshop we will build a tasks management application following the microservices architecture pattern.

Moreover, we will use Redis to store tasks when we are running the application locally. You will see that we can switch between different stores without any code changes, thanks to the Dapr pluggable state stores feature. It is a matter of adding new Dapr Component files and the underlying store will be changed. This page shows the supported state stores in Dapr.</p> <p></p> <p>Dapr's state management API allows you to save, read, and query key/value pairs in the supported state stores. To try this out, and without doing any code changes or installing any NuGet packages, we can directly invoke the State Management API and store the data on Redis locally. When you initialized Dapr in your local development environment, it installed Redis container instance locally. So we can use Redis locally to store and retrieve state. If you navigate to the path <code>%USERPROFILE%\\.dapr\\components</code> (assuming you are using Windows) you will find a file named <code>statestore.yaml</code>.

Pub/Sub Pattern with Dapr","text":"<p>As a best practice, it is recommended that we decouple services from each other. A conventional way to do so is by employing the Publisher-Subscriber (Pub/Sub) pattern. The primary advantage of this pattern is that it offers loose coupling between services where the sender/publisher of the message doesn't know anything about the receivers/consumers. This can be done in a 1-1 or 1-many constellation in which  multiple consumers each receive a copy of the message in a totally different way. For example, imagine adding another consumer which is responsible for sending push notifications to the task owner (e.g. if we had a mobile app channel).</p> <p>In module 3 we introduced you to decoupling <code>ACA Web - Frontend</code> from <code>ACA API - Backend</code> through asynchronous HTTP calls via Dapr. And in module 4 we added integrations with Redis Cache locally and Azure Cosmos DB in the cloud. In this module we will configure such a Pub/Sub pattern to faciliate asynchronous messaging between the microservices. Specifically, the publisher/subscriber pattern relies on a message broker which is responsible for receiving the message from the publisher, storing the message to ensure durability, and delivering this message to the interested consumer(s) to process it. There is no need for the consumers to be available when the message is stored in the message broker. Consumers can process the messages at a later time in an async fashion. The below diagram gives a high-level overview of how the Pub/Sub pattern works:</p> <p></p> <p>If you implemented the Pub/Sub pattern before, you already know that there is a lot of plumbing needed on the publisher and subscriber components in order to publish and consume messages. In addition, each message broker has its own SDK and implementation. So you need to write your code in an abstracted way to hide the specific implementation details for each message broker SDK and make it easier for the publisher and consumers to re-use this functionality. What Dapr offers here is a building block that significantly simplifies implementing Pub/Sub functionality by abstracting the implementation of the provider from the usage of the pattern in the container. Differently, the container does not know who it is interacting with - and this is entirely intentional and favorable for container portability and immutability.</p> <p>Put simply, the Dapr Pub/Sub building block provides a platform-agnostic API framework to send and receive messages. Your producer/publisher services publish messages to a named topic. Your consumer services subscribe to a topic to consume messages.</p>"},{"location":"aca/05-aca-dapr-pubsubapi/#11-testing-pubsub-locally","title":"1.1 Testing Pub/Sub Locally","text":"<p>To try this out we can directly invoke the Pub/Sub API and publish a message to Redis locally. If you remember from module 3, when we initialized Dapr in a local development environment, it installed Redis container instance locally.

If you navigate to the path <code>%USERPROFILE%\\.dapr\\components (assuming you are using windows)</code> you will find a file named <code>pubsub.yaml</code>.

The answer for this is that at startup on the consumer service (more on that below after we add <code>app.MapSubscribeHandler())</code>, the Dapr runtime will call the application on a well-known endpoint to identify and create the required subscriptions.</p> <p>The well-known endpoint can be reached on this endpoint: <code>http://localhost:&lt;appPort&gt;/dapr/subscribe</code>. When you invoke this endpoint, the response will contain an array of all available topics for which the applications will subscribe. Each includes a route to call when the topic receives a message. This was generated as we used the attribute <code>Dapr.Topic</code> on the action method <code>api/tasksnotifier/tasksaved</code>.</p> <p>That means when a message is published on the PubSubname <code>taskspubsub</code> on the topic <code>tasksavedtopic</code>, it will be routed to the action method <code>/api/tasksnotifier/tasksaved</code> and will be consumed in this action method.</p> <p>In our case, a sample response will be as follows:</p> <pre><code>[\n    {\n    \"pubsubname\": \"taskspubsub\",\n    \"topic\": \"tasksavedtopic\",\n    \"route\": \"/api/tasksnotifier/tasksaved\"\n    }\n]\n</code></pre> <p>Tip</p> <p>Follow this link to find a detailed diagram of how the consumers will discover and subscribe to those endpoints.</p>"},{"location":"aca/05-aca-dapr-pubsubapi/#25-register-dapr-and-subscribe-handler-at-the-consumer-startup","title":"2.5 Register Dapr and Subscribe Handler at the Consumer Startup","text":"<p>Update below file in TasksTracker.Processor.Backend.Svc project.</p> .NET 8.NET 9 Program.cs <pre><code>var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\n// Add services to the container.\n\nbuilder.Services.AddControllers().AddDapr();\n// Learn more about configuring Swagger/OpenAPI at https://aka.ms/aspnetcore/swashbuckle\nbuilder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();\nbuilder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();\n\nvar app = builder.Build();\n\n// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.\nif (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())\n{\n    app.UseSwagger();\n    app.UseSwaggerUI();\n}\n\napp.UseHttpsRedirection();\n\napp.UseAuthorization();\n\napp.UseCloudEvents();\n\napp.MapControllers();\n\napp.MapSubscribeHandler();\n\napp.Run();\n</code></pre> Program.cs <pre><code>var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\n// Add services to the container.\n\nbuilder.Services.AddControllers().AddDapr();\n// Learn more about configuring OpenAPI at https://aka.ms/aspnet/openapi\nbuilder.Services.AddOpenApi();\n\nvar app = builder.Build();\n\n// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.\nif (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())\n{\n    app.MapOpenApi();\n}\n\napp.UseHttpsRedirection();\n\napp.UseAuthorization();\n\napp.UseCloudEvents();\n\napp.MapControllers();\n\napp.MapSubscribeHandler();\n\napp.Run();\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Let's verify that the Dapr dependency is restored properly and that the project compiles.

Interfacing with an External System","text":"<p>To achieve interfacing with an external system in a simple way, we will utilize Dapr Input and Output Bindings.</p> <p>The external system owns an Azure Storage Queue which the Tasks Tracker microservice application reacts to through an event handler (aka Input Binding). This event handler receives and processes the message coming to the storage queue. Once the processing of the message completes and stores the task into Cosmos DB, the system will trigger an event (aka Output binding) that invokes the external service. This service, in turn, stores the content of the message into an Azure Blob Storage container. It is important to emphasize that both the Azure Storage Queue and the Azure Storage Blob belong to the external system.</p> <p>The rest of this module will implement the three scenarios mentioned below:</p> <ul> <li>Trigger a process on the <code>ACA-Processor Backend</code> based on a message sent to a specific Azure Storage Queue. This scenario will assume that the Azure Storage Queue is an external system to which external clients can submit tasks.</li> <li>From the service <code>ACA-Processor Backend</code> we will invoke an external resource that stores the content of the incoming task from the external queue as a JSON blob file on Azure Storage Blobs.</li> <li>Remove the SendGrid SDK as well as the custom code created in the previous module to send emails and replace it with Dapr SendGrid output binding.</li> </ul> <p>Take a look at the high-level architecture diagram below to understand the flow of input and output bindings in Dapr:</p> <p></p> <p>Note</p> <p>Those 3rd party external services could be services hosted on another cloud provider, different Azure subscription, or even on premise. Dapr bindings are usually used to trigger an application with events coming in from external systems as well as interface with external systems.</p> <p>For simplicity of the workshop we are going to host those two supposedly external services in the same subscription of our Tasks Tracker microservice application.</p> <p>If you look at Dapr Bindings Building Block, you will notice a lot of similarities with the Pub/Sub Building Block that we covered in the previous module. But remember that Pub/Sub Building Block is meant to be used for async communication between services within your solution. The Binding Building Block has a wider scope and it mainly focuses on connectivity and interoperability across different systems, disparate applications, and services outside the boundaries of your own application. For a full list of supported bindings visit this link.</p>"},{"location":"aca/06-aca-dapr-bindingsapi/#11-overview-of-dapr-bindings-building-block","title":"1.1 Overview of Dapr Bindings Building Block","text":"<p>Let's take a look at the detailed Dapr Bindings Building Block architecture diagram that we are going to implement in this module to fulfill the use case we discussed earlier: </p> <p>Looking at the diagram we notice the following:</p> <ul> <li>In order to receive events and data from the external resource (Azure Storage Queue) our <code>ACA-Processor Backend</code> service needs to register a public endpoint that will become an event handler.</li> <li>This binding configuration between the external resource and our service will be configured by using the <code>Input Binding Configuration Yaml</code> file. The Dapr sidecar of the background service will read the configuration and subscribe to the endpoint defined for the external resource. In our case, it will be a specific Azure Storage Queue.</li> <li>When a message is published to the storage queue, the input binding component running in the Dapr sidecar picks it up and triggers the event.</li> <li>The Dapr sidecar invokes the endpoint (event handler defined in the <code>ACA-Processor Backend</code> Service) configured for the binding. In our case, it will be an endpoint that can be reached by invoking a <code>POST</code> operation <code>http://localhost:3502/ExternalTasksProcessor/Process</code> and the request body content will be the JSON payload of the published message to the Azure Storage Queue.</li> <li>When the event is handled in our <code>ACA-Processor Backend</code> and the business logic is completed, this endpoint needs to return an HTTP response with a <code>200 OK</code> status to acknowledge that processing is complete. If the event handling is not completed or there is an error, this endpoint should return an HTTP 4xx or 5xx status code.</li> <li>In order to enable the service <code>ACA-Processor Backend</code> to trigger an event that invokes an external resource, we need to use the <code>Output Binding Configuration Yaml</code> file to configure the binding between our service and the external resource (Azure Blob Storage) and how to connect to it.</li> <li>Once the Dapr sidecar reads the binding configuration file, our service can trigger an event that invokes the output binding API on the Dapr sidecar. In our case, the event will be creating a new blob file containing the content of the message we read earlier from the Azure Storage Queue.</li> <li> <p>With this in place, our service <code>ACA-Processor Backend</code> will be ready to invoke the external resource by sending a POST operation to the endpoint <code>http://localhost:3502/v1.0/bindings/ExternalTasksBlobstore</code> and the JSON payload will contain the content below. Alternatively, we can use the Dapr client SDK to invoke this output biding to invoke the external service and store the file in Azure Blob Storage.</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"data\": \"{\n        \"taskName\": \"Task Coming from External System\",\n        \"taskAssignedTo\": \"user1@hotmail.com\",\n        \"taskCreatedBy\": \"tjoudeh@bitoftech.net\",\n        \"taskDueDate\": \"2022-08-19T12:45:22.0983978Z\"\n    }\",\n    \"operation\": \"create\"\n}\n</code></pre> </li> </ul> <p>Let's start by updating our Backend Background Processor project and define the input and output bindings configuration files and event handlers.</p> <p>To proceed with this workshop, we need to provision the Azure Storage Account to start responding to messages published to a queue and then later use the same storage account to store blob files as an external event. Run the PowerShell script below to create Azure Storage Account and get the master key.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>We will be retrieving the storage account key for local dev testing purposes. Note that the command below will return two keys. You will only need one of them for this exercise.

We intend to utilize this binding for a specific use case, wherein it will be triggered once daily at a particular time (12:05 am), and search for tasks that have a due date matching the previous day of its execution and are still pending. Once the service identifies tasks that meet these criteria, it will designate them as overdue tasks and save the revised status on Azure Cosmos DB.</p> <p>Contrasting the binding to Azure Container Apps jobs, we do not need a separate container app and can integrate this binding into our existing backend service.</p>"},{"location":"aca/07-aca-cron-bindings/#2-updating-the-backend-background-processor-project","title":"2.

This means your application can automatically handle higher (or lower) workloads, ensuring your system maintains its availability and performance.</p> <p>Azure Container Apps support horizontal scaling, also known as scaling out and scaling in. Respectively, when demand increases, Azure Container Apps can add (scale out) replicas (new instances of the container app), thus splitting the workload across multiple replicas to process the work in parallel. Ideally, this keeps the workload per instance somewhat consistent with that instance's capacity. Conversely, when demand decreases, Azure Container Apps will remove (scale In) un- or under-utilized replicas according to your configured scaling rule. With this consumption-oriented approach, you pay only for the replicas provisioned at any time. You can also configure the scaling rule to scale to zero replicas, resulting in no costs being incurred when your Container App scales down to zero. However, be aware that scaling to zero for critical workloads is advised against.</p>"},{"location":"aca/09-aca-autoscale-keda/#11-scaling-triggers","title":"1.1 Scaling Triggers","text":"<p>Azure Container Apps supports different scaling triggers including:</p> <ul> <li>HTTP traffic: Scaling based on the number of concurrent HTTP requests to your revision.</li> <li>CPU or Memory usage: Scaling based on the amount of CPU utilized or memory consumed by a replica.</li> <li>Azure Storage Queues: Scaling based on the number of messages in Azure Storage Queue.</li> <li>Event-driven using KEDA: Scaling based on events triggers, such as the number of messages in Azure Service Bus Topic or the number of blobs in Azure Blob Storage container.</li> </ul> <p>As we covered in the introductory module, Azure Container Apps utilize different open source technologies, including KEDA, which facilitate tasks such as event-driven autoscaling.

An Overview of Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaler (KEDA)","text":"<p>KEDA stands for Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaler. It is an open-source project initially started by Microsoft and Red Hat to allow any Kubernetes workload to benefit from the event-driven architecture model. Prior to KEDA, horizontally scaling a Kubernetes deployment was achieved through the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). The HPA relies on resource metrics such as Memory and CPU to determine when additional replicas should be deployed. In an enterprise application, there may be additional external metrics that we want to use to scale our application, such as the length of a Kafka topic log, an Azure Service Bus Queue, or metrics obtained from a Prometheus query. In short, scaling considerations are likely to be increasingly complex as your applications and ecosystem grow. KEDA offers more than 50 scalers to pick from based on your business need. KEDA exists to fill this gap and provides a framework for scaling based on events in conjunction with HPA scaling based on CPU and Memory.</p>"},{"location":"aca/09-aca-autoscale-keda/#3-configure-scaling-rule-in-backend-background-processor-project","title":"3.

Those tasks are Dapr tasks.</p> <p>The Dapr VSCode extension we have previously installed helps us to define those pre- and post-debug tasks.</p> <p>To accomplish this, open the file tasks.json and click Ctrl+Shift+P, and type Dapr: Scaffold Dapr Tasks.</p> <p>The Dapr VS Code extension will allow us to manage Dapr application and test it out in an easier way, the below image shows a full list of helper commands.</p> <p></p> <p>Now we will add 4 tasks, for each application, there will be a task to support the <code>preLaunch</code> activity and the <code>postDebug</code> activity (Terminate/Exit Dapr Sidecar process), so open file tasks.json and add the tasks below:</p> tasks.json <pre><code>{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"appId\": \"tasksmanager-backend-api\",\n      \"appPort\": [web api application port number found under properties-&gt;launchSettings.json. e.g. 7112],\n      \"httpPort\": 3500,\n      \"grpcPort\": 50001,\n      \"appSsl\": true,\n      \"label\": \"backend-api-dapr-debug\",\n      \"type\": \"dapr\",\n      \"dependsOn\": \"build-backend-api\",\n      // Uncomment this line after adding Azure Cosmos DB in module 4\n      //\"componentsPath\": \"./components\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"appId\": \"tasksmanager-backend-api\",\n      \"label\": \"daprd-down-backend-api\",\n      \"type\": \"daprd-down\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"appId\": \"tasksmanager-frontend-webapp\",\n      \"appPort\": [frontend application port number found under properties-&gt;launchSettings.json. e.g. 7112],\n      \"httpPort\": 3501,\n      \"grpcPort\": 50002,\n      \"appSsl\": true,\n      \"label\": \"webapp-ui-dapr-debug\",\n      \"type\": \"dapr\",\n      \"dependsOn\": \"build-webapp-ui\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"appId\": \"tasksmanager-frontend-webapp\",\n      \"label\": \"webapp-ui-daprd-down\",\n      \"type\": \"daprd-down\"\n    }\n  ]}\n</code></pre> Curious to learn more about the tasks.json file above? <ul> <li>The tasks with the label <code>backend-api-dapr-debug</code> will invoke the <code>daprd</code> task. This task is similar to calling dapr run from CLI.</li> <li>We are setting the appPort, httpPort, and grpcPort properties (grpcPort is needed in future modules when we start using the state manager building block. If you didn't set it, you might face a similar issue)</li> <li>We are setting the \"componentsPath\" property. This is needed when start working with the state manager, pub/sub, etc.</li> <li>We are setting the dependsOn property, so this means this task will fire after the dependsOn tasks complete successfully. We need to add those dependsOn tasks.</li> <li>The tasks with the label <code>daprd-down-backend-api</code> will terminate the Dapr Sidecar process. This will be used for the <code>postDebug</code> activity in configuration.json.</li> <li>For a complete list of available properties please check this link.</li> </ul> <p>Next let's add the dependsOn tasks.
