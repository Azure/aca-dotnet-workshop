## Prerequisites

The workshop is divided into separate modules. Each module will guide you through building the solution code step-by-step. Ensure that you finish the modules in the right order as they have dependencies on each other.

Make sure you have your development environment set up and configured.

## Set up Git Repository & Variable Scripts

### Git Repository

This workshop typically spans several days. As such, you may close your tools, end CLI sessions, reboot, or simply want to persist working implementations in a repository as each module builds upon the one before it. A local Git repository can help.

- Open a command-line terminal and create a folder for your project, then switch to that folder.

    === "Windows"
        ```shell
        md TasksTracker.ContainerApps
        cd TasksTracker.ContainerApps
        ```
    === "Linux"
        ```shell
        mkdir ~\TasksTracker.ContainerApps
        cd ~\TasksTracker.ContainerApps
        ```

- Initialize the git repository.

    ```shell
    git init
    ```

- Use the `code` command to launch Visual Studio Code from that directory as shown:

    ```shell
    code .
    ```

- From VS Code's *Terminal* tab, select *New Terminal* to open a (PowerShell) terminal in the project folder *TasksTracker.ContainerApps*.

!!! note
    Throughout the documentation, we may refer to the *TasksTracker.ContainerApps* directory as *root* to keep documentation simpler.

- In the root create a `.gitignore` file. This ensures we keep our git repo clean of build assets and other artifacts.

    === ".gitignore"
        ```shell
        # Exclude build artifacts
        **/obj/
        **/bin/
        **/dist/
        ```

- Commit the `.gitignore` file.

    ```shell
    git add .\.gitignore
    git commit -m "Add .gitignore"
    ```

### Set-Variables & Variables Script

- In the root create a new file called `Set-Variables.ps1`.

- Copy the [Set-Variables.ps1 script](../../aca/30-appendix/03-variables.md){target=_blank} into the newly-created `Set-Variables.ps1` file and save it.

- Execute the script. You will do this repeatedly throughout the modules. The output of the script will inform you how many variables are written out. As we have not yet defined any variables, the output will indicate that the script has exited (without writing out to the file). This is intentional and expected at this stage.

    ```shell
    .\Set-Variables.ps1
    ```

- Commit the `Set-Variables.ps1` file.

    ```shell
    git add .\Set-Variables.ps1
    git commit -m "Add Set-Variables.ps1"
    ```

This completes the basic setup for Git and the variables to be used. You are ready to proceed to [Module 1](../01-deploy-api-to-aca/index.md)!

## Jump Ahead

If you don't want to build the solution code from scratch, you can clone the source code repository final version by utilizing below command, and you can use the modules to deploy Azure resources using the provided Azure CLI commands.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Azure/aca-dotnet-workshop.git
```
