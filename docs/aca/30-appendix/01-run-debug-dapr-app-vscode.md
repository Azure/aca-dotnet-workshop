This page shows you how to configure VSCode to run and debug multiple Dapr applications at same time.

### Debug and launch Dapr applications in VSCode

We need to update VS code `tasks.json` and `launch.json` configuration files included in your workspace. Once completed you should be able to use the Run and Debug button on the activity bar within VS Code to launch all services to be able to debug them locally.

First we need to add a new launch configuration for the Backend Web API and Frontend Web App projects.
To accomplish this, open file `launch.json` and add the two configurations shown below.

!!! note
    Make sure you append the configurations below to the existing array instead of replacing what you have. This way you will preserve your existing configuration and simply add two new ones.

    ??? example "Looking for complete launch.json?"
        
        === "launch.json"
            
            ```json
            --8<-- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/aca-dotnet-workshop/main/.vscode/launch.json"
            ```

=== "launch.json"

    ```json
    --8<-- "docs/aca/30-appendix/launch.json"
    ```

!!! note
    We have a `preLaunchTask` and a `postDebugTask` which we need to define right now. Those tasks are Dapr tasks.

The [Dapr VSCode extension](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/ides/vscode/vscode-dapr-extension/#scaffold-dapr-debugging-tasks){target=_blank} we have previously installed helps us to define those pre- and post-debug tasks.

To accomplish this, open the file **tasks.json** and click ++ctrl+shift+p++, and type **Dapr: Scaffold Dapr Tasks**.

The Dapr VS Code extension will allow us to manage Dapr application and test it out in an easier way, the below image shows a full list of helper commands.

Now we will add 4 tasks, for each application, there will be a task to support the `preLaunch` activity and the `postDebug` activity (Terminate/Exit Dapr Sidecar process), so open file tasks.json and add the tasks below:

=== "tasks.json"

    ```json
    --8<-- "docs/aca/30-appendix/tasks.json"
    ```

??? tip "Curious to learn more about the tasks.json file above?"

    * The tasks with the label `backend-api-dapr-debug` will invoke the `daprd` task. This task is similar to calling dapr run from CLI.
    * We are setting the appPort, httpPort, and grpcPort properties (grpcPort is needed in future modules when we start using the state manager building block. 
    If you didn't set it, you might face a similar [issue](https://github.com/dapr/dotnet-sdk/issues/609){target=_blank})
    * We are setting the “componentsPath” property. This is needed when start working with the state manager, pub/sub, etc.
    * We are setting the dependsOn property, so this means this task will fire after the dependsOn tasks complete successfully. We need to add those dependsOn tasks.
    * The tasks with the label `daprd-down-backend-api` will terminate the Dapr Sidecar process. This will be used for the `postDebug` activity in configuration.json.
    * For a complete list of available properties please check this [link.](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/ides/vscode/vscode-how-to-debug-multiple-dapr-apps/#daprd-parameter-table){target=_blank}

Next let's add the dependsOn tasks. Open `tasks.json` and add the tasks below:

```json title="tasks.json"
{
    "label": "build-backend-api",
    "command": "dotnet",
    "type": "process",
    "args": [
        "build",
        "${workspaceFolder}/TasksTracker.TasksManager.Backend.Api/TasksTracker.TasksManager.Backend.Api.csproj",
        "/property:GenerateFullPaths=true",
        "/consoleloggerparameters:NoSummary"
    ],
    "problemMatcher": "$msCompile"
},
{
    "label": "build-webapp-ui",
    "command": "dotnet",
    "type": "process",
    "args": [
        "build",
        "${workspaceFolder}/TasksTracker.WebPortal.Frontend.Ui/TasksTracker.WebPortal.Frontend.Ui.csproj",
        "/property:GenerateFullPaths=true",
        "/consoleloggerparameters:NoSummary"
    ],
    "problemMatcher": "$msCompile"
}
```

??? example "Looking for complete tasks.json?"

    === "tasks.json"
        
    ```json
    --8<-- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/aca-dotnet-workshop/main/.vscode/tasks.json"
    ```

Lastly, we need to add a `compound launch` property, so we launch and debug both applications together.

To accomplish this, open the file `launch.json` again and add the below array after the `configuration` array.

```json title="launch.json"
"compounds": [
    {
        "name": "RunAll with Dapr",
        "configurations": [
            "Launch (backend api) with Dapr",
            "Launch (web app) with Dapr"
        ],
        "stopAll": true
    }
]
```

!!! success
    If all is done correctly, you should be able to see a debug configuration named `RunAll with Dapr` and you should be able to just hit ++F5++, sit breakpoints and debug both applications locally in VS Code.
